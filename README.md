A repository for the Magnetar Unit Switcher, originally for Multiverse, but now with Unity.

This is a proof of concept unit switching demo in Unity.

Physics based movement, a quick terrain, some colorful shapes to play around with.

WASD to move, left click and hold to move the camera, right click on another shape and press the 
prompted button to switch your control to that shape.
